### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University.

🌱 I got my B.S in Software Engineering at East China Normal University (华东师范大学).

😄 I previously interned as a software engineer at Amazon, Fossil Group, and PowerInfo. And I dived deep into distributed database systems as a research assistant under an ETH Zurich senior researcher for almost 2 years.

🤔 I’m actively seeking a full-time software engineer position, and I will graduate in Feb. 2023!
